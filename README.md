# X-Math

Hello! This is Polop Technologies newest invention.
A Data Bot!
This is how it works:

1. You Choose a Number between 1 and INFINITE.
2. It Creates a list, storing EVERY number in between of 1 and the one you chose.
3. It Multiplies every number in the list by so: xÂ². X is the number and it is squared.
4. Then it will print each one and show you the sum.
5. Then you may type in a number of the ones in your list and it will show you their squared result.
6. Then it will ask you if you would like to add it to a seperate list. This list allows you to sum every number in its contents.

4, 5 and 6 are in a loop, so you can do it again and again until you write something not in the computer's data.

We know its complicated so why don't we show you? Download it and use it for yourself!
